It has been months since I have been looking for my first job, and yes, I know that if I wanted, I could already have a job in my country doing what most people do. But I need to try getting my first dream job first.

In this blog post, I will tell you about these last months, what I have needed to learn, what I am learning, how this can affect someone's motivation, and what my expectations are for the future.

For you, this may seem banal, but putting this blog live means a lot to me. To put this running, I needed to learn [Fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/) tools ([Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) and [Bartholomew](https://github.com/fermyon/bartholomew)), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), and this hasn't been easy. Fortunately, people from the other side of the world have helped me solve all my problems.

## My first job hunting marathon üèÉ (when is this end?)

Finally, finally, finally!

Here is my blog compiled entirely to WebAssembly using a simple CMS-like from [Fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/) called [Bartholomew](https://github.com/fermyon/bartholomew).

A few months back, I finished a Master's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Minho. After taking some time for myself, I decided that before of take any job offer, I should go after my first dream job. That job is working with something englobing WebAssembly because after my dissertation research, I have decided that I want WebAssembly to be in my future. I love WebAssembly, believe in its potential, and want to be part of it.

So, I went after companies already working with WebAssembly and found an [article](https://reneeshah.medium.com/how-webassembly-gets-used-the-18-most-exciting-startups-building-with-wasm-939474e951db) with 18 companies. I sent them, and others, my r√©sum√© telling them how passionate and motivated I am to work with them because of WebAssembly. Actually, I had some chats with people from those companies that wanted to know me even though they didn't have job openings for someone like me. Therefore, no luck, mostly because I don't have the experience they need. Since WebAssembly is very recent, they need to invest their time and resources in their products and not in junior engineers.

At that moment, I realized that I probably nedded to start opening my horizons and look for any job for an entry-level like me. I would love to work remotely to work with different people from different countries and cultures and have opportunities to travel. So, I have sent dozens of r√©sum√©s to all the job openings I have found but, again, no luck.

I was losing my motivation and wasn't seeing any progress, feeling incapable of doing things and almost doubting myself. One day I found a post from someone working with WebAssembly, so I sent him a message asking if there was a job opening for someone like me. The answer was no, but Mr. Daniel wanted to have a chat with me anyway. I told my "story" to Mr. Daniel, who spent almost an hour of his day giving me the best insights I could get. He told me that I needed to do something different than just sending r√©sum√©s because if some company offered me a job, it would not be because of my capabilities right now but because of my potential. He also talked about Rust and how Rust is close to WebAssembly's world. He gave me the idea of doing a Website with WebAssembly and published some blogpost to share who I am and what I am doing. The icing on the cake was that he bought me a book to give me motivation in this journey and learn some Rust. The book is  [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/).

Since then, I have been reading the book and learning Rust (I am doing a project in Rust to see if I have more luck). I am also building this website that gave me headaches because I needed to learn new things such as [Fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/) tools ([Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) and [Bartholomew](https://github.com/fermyon/bartholomew)), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

You can say that I am being greedy, that if I wanted, I already had a job here in my country - a lot of people are telling me that -but first, I need to try as hard as I can to find my first dream job.

Finally, I hope you, reading this, are my lucky charm and know some job openings for me. Please get in touch!
