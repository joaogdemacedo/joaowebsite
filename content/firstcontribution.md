During this blog development, I was faced with many things that weren’t working correctly, or it just wasn’t working. Some were because I was doing things the wrong way, others due to problems with my system, and others due to the project itself. Since Bartholomew and Spin are projects in progress, many things need to be improved or fixed, just like any project. Therefore, I had the chance to make [my first contribution](https://github.com/fermyon/installer/pull/102) to [Fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/) with a simple pull request.

## My first pull request 

This is my first pull request for an open-source project. It was a simple contribution, but it is already better than nothing, right? So, my first contribution was editing the guide that illustrates how to install [Fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/) on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

When I tried to check the vault status, it wasn't configured to use a certificate. So, it needed to be updated to the correct command. And so, that was what I did. I edited a single command in a `README` file.

I also need to learn how to make a pull request, perform the DCO sign-off, ensure that the commit is GPG-signed, and amend commits correctly. The pull request was verified and accepted with a bit of help from Mr. Vaughn.

A straightforward contribution that made me very happy! I hope I can contribute more from now on.
This was the testimony of my first contribution, and it will be funny in a couple of years when I read this.

Thank you for reading!
