Hi there, my name is [João Gonçalves De Macedo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaodemacedo134/), I am 26 years old, and I am from Portugal. This is my Blog Website entirely served from [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) modules, thanks to [Fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/).

I have recently finished a Master’s Degree in Software Engineering at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN). With my dissertation research, WebAssembly became my main interest. Thus, learning Rust is one of my main goals in order to be part of WebAssembly’s future. I am not an expert. However, one of the most important skills I have learned at University is to be self-taught. Overall, I am a happy guy 😁

> **At this moment, I am looking for my first job/internship in WebAssembly or Rust, but it hasn’t been that easy. Please take a look at [My first blog post](https://spin-deploy.joao-website.hippo.joaodemacedo.com/firstpost) to read my testimony of these months of looking for my first job.**

### Publications 📖

During my last two years at University (2019 - 2022), while completing my Master’s Degree and later my dissertation, I joined a Research Laboratory called [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en). The team I was in, [Green Software Lab](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/), works on reducing energy consumption across various computing systems.

Alongside friends and teachers, I am one of three research papers' main authors.

After my first research paper on the energy consumption of Web browsers, my supervisor showed me an article about WebAssembly. I remember perfectly the first time I read it and had no idea what this thing called WebAssembly was. It was at that moment that I started to be a fan of WebAssembly.

Therefore, I choose WebAssembly as my dissertation theme, and here I am with two research papers on WebAssembly runtime and energy performance.


###### Research papers

1. [Energy wars - Chrome vs. Firefox: which browser is more energy efficient?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3417113.3423000)
2. [On the Runtime and Energy Performance of WebAssembly: Is WebAssembly superior to JavaScript yet?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9680302?casa_token=Lr5eizKsKJgAAAAA:Bd_wx3iJNR0ZJarQOVQ1x1PuIm0T43PYS4SMsnMYR5DFjmNKLjsAmHHr6CuQXjz2P-BgiN5C)
3. [WebAssembly versus JavaScript: Energy and Runtime Performance](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9830108?casa_token=M_jQF_B9QXwAAAAA:z3foTA5w4lFOo860_ZPMhL2hjnzQZnHYZtDIyAiOVDTLTNicQMOgfXGQVr2-ZSidV5fxAZY)

### Experiences 💼

At this moment, my professional experience is scarce. I've worked all summers since my 18s, but not in software engineering. I've worked in my family's garage ([Auto Feira Nova](https://autofeiranova.negocio.site/)), and I still do when I have free time - e.g., Saturday morning - to help my family's business.

My only experiences in software engineering close to a professional environment were [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en) and a project with a company called [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/) during one semester.

- 2014 to Present - [Auto Feira Nova](https://autofeiranova.negocio.site/)
- 2021 to 2022 - [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en)
- 2020 to 2021 - Project with [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/)
